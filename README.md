# Liveness_detection
This project uses a YOLO-based model for real-time liveness detection, ensuring the captured face belongs to a live person rather than a photo or video. It is widely used in KYC (Know Your Customer) products to prevent identity fraud, verify user authenticity, and enhance the security of digital onboarding and biometric verification systems.
